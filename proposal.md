# Collect the Fruit!

## Repository


## Description
"Collect the Fruit" is an interactive game where the player collects falling fruits continously-- with the falling speed increasing over time-- until one fruit touches the ground.

## Features
- Falling randomized fruit objects
	- Use classes to create and draw raining fruits.

- Animated player character
	- Create a class and put together sequence of frames by appending it to a list.

- Increased fruit speed difficulty
	- Utilize if statements to determine a certain time checkpoint or point count that increases speed.


## Challenges
- Learn how to detect collision to either add a point or end the game.
- Learn how to animate a character when pressing a key that moves them.
- Make the particles fall fairly with enough time and space for the player to collect and move.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The animated player presses start to move around and collect different rotating fruits falling from the top and a score keeping count of the fruits collected. If one touches the ground, the player loses. The more they collect, the faster the fruits will fall.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The non-animated player moves around to collect red circle particles falling from the top. If one fruit touches the ground, the player loses.
