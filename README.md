## Description
My project is meant to be a small little game where apples fall from a tree. The player controls a white basket that moves left to right at a fair speed to catch the apples. The player's score increases by one for every apple caught. If the apple touches the ground, the player loses the game.

Each file in stored in the graphics folder are the image icons used in the game. All image files except for the object pngs were drawn by me and imported over. The latter were resized with pillow since the art program I use had limits on its canvas size. Once transformed, they were loaded and displayed into the game. The apple and basket are the main moving icons while tree leaves and trunk were used as a type of background.

The nature design is simple, but spacious. I originally added two background trees to fill the space around the main tree, but it made seeing the apples difficult, so I scrapped it. One design idea that came to me, however, is adding slow-moving clouds in the background. Other ideas include grass details and non-moving baskets filled with apples or other fruit, since I originally intended to randomize the type of fruit falling.

Though I like how it turned out so far, I do need to work on properly implementing collision between the apples and the basket. I also need to work on handling classes and understand them further, since at times I felt confused or made an incorrect call. Looking at module documents is especially important when using a module for the first time. Rather than skim through, I need to slow down and take in the options offered. I certainly had my struggles, and I will do my best to learn from them for fufure projects.
